Invisible Radio 
(please refer to my slides and presentation for futher info)
Inspired by a room in the 180-strand exhibition, 
I  created my invisible radio project using a Grove Pulse Sensor.
Creating a pulsing, colorful circle that syncs with your heartbeat, all tied together with some piano sound effects.
The interaction lets people see the direct link between their own heartbeat and the sound.
